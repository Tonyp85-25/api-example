            # Determine the RewriteBase automatically and set it as environment variable.

            # If you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual hosting or installed the

            # project in a subdirectory, the base path will be prepended to allow proper

            # resolution of the index.php file and to redirect to the correct URI. It will

            # work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, one-size

            # fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment

            # the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead.

            # redirect -> request -> ...).

            # to the start page because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECT_STATUS

            # environment variable, you have 2 choices:

            # - disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or

            # - use Apache >= 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the

            #   following RewriteCond (best solution)

            # RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} ^$
